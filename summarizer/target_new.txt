– it ' s a race for the governor ' s mansion in 11 states today , and the gop could end the night at the helm of more than two-thirds of the 50 states . the gop currently controls 29 of the country ' s top state offices ; it ' s expected to keep the three republican ones that are up for grabs ( utah , north dakota , and indiana ) , and wrest north carolina from the dems . that brings its toll to 30 , with the potential to take three more , reports npr . races in montana , new hampshire , and washington are still too close to call , and in all three , democrat incumbents aren ' t seeking reelection . the results could have a big impact on health care , since a supreme court ruling grants states the ability to opt out of obamacare ' s medicaid expansion . " a romney victory would dramatically empower republican governors , " said one analyst . click for npr ' s state-by-state breakdown of what could happen .
– it turns out facebook is only guilty of about half of what it ’ s been accused of in the gay kiss incident . the social networking site apologized yesterday for taking down an image used to promote a “kiss-in ” event in london . “the photo in question does not violate our statement of rights and responsibilities , and was removed in error , ” the site said in a statement , according to the advocate . but facebook did not , as has been reported in several places , take down the kiss-in event itself . here ’ s what happened : the photo facebook took down was posted by the dangerous minds blog to promote the event . in its initial write-up about the incident , the blog observed that the page organizing the protest had been taken down . but it was actually the organizer himself who " removed " the event , dangerous minds clarified . organizer paul shetler explains that he decided to switch it from a public event to a private one , as " there were starting to be trolls posting abusive nonsense on it .

– not a big fan of southern california ? neither is northern california , apparently . supervisors in rural siskiyou county voted 4-1 tuesday in favor of seceding from the state , reports the times-standard . the county thinks state officials in sacramento are too focused on the big metro areas of the south and thus want to form a state of its own — to be called jefferson . supporters want to invite other northern counties , and perhaps a few from oregon , to join , too , notes the los angeles times . ” we have to have government that ' s local , understands our issues , and has empathy , ” says one local rancher . it ' s clearly a very long-shot bid , one that would eventually require the blessing of both the state legislature and the us congress . still , neighboring humboldt county is expected to meet soon to consider the idea . ( meanwhile , some counties in colorado want to form a new state of their own. )
– why did microsoft buy nokia ' s phone business ? we now know microsoft ' s answer : the computing giant released a 30-slide presentation today arguing that the move will improve microsoft ' s margins on windows phones , which will allow it to invest more in the platform , which will accelerate sales and market share growth , the washington post reports . but john herrman at buzzfeed has another explanation : " fear of dying alone . " here ' s what he and other pundits are saying : the presentation " manages to sound both insane and uninspiring , outlining modest goals that still sound unrealistic , " herman argues — like capturing a whole 15 % of the smartphone market . " it ' s a fitting end for the close of microsoft ' s ballmer era , during which the company … missed out on the most important change in consumer electronics in decades " while remaining profitable in unglamorous ways . like everyone , microsoft is trying to ape the apple model , mobileopportunity observes . but it ' s not so sure that ' s a good idea . " there already is an apple , " the blog points out , and other software/hardware hybrid companies , like palm and blackberry , have been crushed under its heel . maybe microsoft should have tried to patch up its tried-and-true strategy of licensing its os . the move risks complicating microsoft ' s crucial relationships with other pc and device manufacturers , one analyst tells zdnet . but he adds that " microsoft needed to make a bold move " or face " certain terminal decline , " and that the price it paid for nokia " seems extremely reasonable . " meanwhile , matthew yglesias at slate digs up a fairly interesting memo from nokia ceo ( and , perhaps , microsoft heir apparent ) stephen elop , in which he uses the story of a deepwater horizon worker leaping from the burning oil platform — a seemingly desperate , yet necessary move — to explain the company ' s shift from its own failed os to windows phone . of course , yglesias notes , that move " was basically a total failure .

– the supreme court is facing a docket of high-profile political cases that will test whether recent liberal victories were more fluke or firm conviction , the new york times reports . the court — which is divided 5-4 for conservatives , but saw justice roberts vote liberal on obamacare and same-sex marriage — will look at cases including unions , affirmative action , and possibly abortion . a primer : unions : since 1977 , unions have been allowed to charge non-union workers for dues that go to collective bargaining efforts , but not political ones . now california teachers have brought a case saying collective bargaining is itself political . " it could set the stage for a citizens united-style reconsideration in the area of union dues , " a lawyer says . affirmative action : abigail fisher says that being white played a role in the university of texas denying her admission back in 2008. the supreme court punted on her case in 2013 , and now it ' s back on the docket . like the unions case , this was brought by a conservative group that recruited the plaintiffs . the death penalty : justices will decide on capital-punishment cases in pennsylvania , kansas , georgia , and florida , the wall street journal reports . justices ruth bader ginsburg and stephen breyer have already expressed doubts about whether capital punishment is constitutional . " one person , one vote " : should state legislative districts be drawn based on their number of people or eligible voters ? if justices choose the latter — leaving out immigrants and children — latinos could lose political clout and rural areas will gain , politico reports . abortion : justices may opt to revisit a texas law that could reduce the state ' s abortion clinics from more than 40 to roughly 10. at issue is whether new clinic requirements are an " undue burden " on women ' s right to an abortion . one commentator believes this supreme court session will be ugly for liberals .
– in 1783 , after the british soldiers left new york city , george washington is believed to have stopped for a celebratory drink at the bull ' s head tavern . now a preservationist thinks he ' s found the historic site — and if he ' s right , it could be the oldest building in manhattan . adam woodward had heard that the building at 50 bowery , currently scheduled to be demolished so a hotel can go up , might have " the bull ' s head ' s structure , cellar , bones , " he tells cbs new york . so he searched the basement , and " found myself in what i am pretty certain is the 1750s historic tavern , " he says . specifically , he found what he thinks are hand-hewn and hand-planed joists and foundation walls from the colonial era . since that time , the building has housed a drugstore , a chinese restaurant , and a beer garden , among other things . now he ' s hoping city officials will preserve the site , saying , " what an incredible opportunity that the city suddenly has for this thing to re-emerge . " a historian is also convinced it is indeed the old tavern , and investigations have been launched by elected officials and the landmarks preservation commission , eater ny reports . but ultimately , the commission says , it " cannot require the owner to conduct archaeology , " so a lot depends on him . he ' s apparently not talking yet ; the new york times couldn ' t get hold of him .
– israel launched a round of airstrikes on gaza today , wounding two militants and eight bystanders , including some children . israel says the attack was retaliation for a round of palestinian rockets fired yesterday , which palestinians say were in response to another israeli airstrike earlier in the day , reuters reports . more than 470 rockets have been fired from gaza since june , but this was the first time hamas acknowledged responsibility . as usual the rockets failed to harm anyone , though one did kill some goats at a petting zoo . the incident comes in the wake of a drone flight into israeli airspace this weekend , which some have speculated came from iran . an iranian military official today boasted that the incident proved that israel is vulnerable , and that its anti-missile defense system " does not work and lacks the necessary capacity .

– rome wasn ' t built in a day , but it looks like its christmas tree may have been . the " toilet brush " of a tree now standing in one of the city ' s busiest public squares and being roundly mocked in italy and around the world makes charlie brown ' s christmas tree look lush by comparison . the new york times reports that the 72-foot-tall norway spruce erected in the piazza venezia and nicknamed " spelacchio , " or " mangy , " will cost the city about $ 57,000 in all — and locals are outraged that so much money was outlayed for a tree that one expert says " has clearly been traumatized .

– day three of the brett kavanaugh confirmation hearing has opened with a bang : democratic sen. cory booker says he has ordered his staff to release a kavanaugh email even though it ' s supposed to remain under wraps . it ' s not clear yet what the email says , but nbc news reports that it concerns racial profiling . booker called his act one of civil disobedience , reports npr . " i openly invite and accept the consequences , " he said , per cnn . " the penalty comes with potential ousting from the senate . " indeed , senate majority whip john cornyn read aloud rules stating that a senator who divulges " the secret or confidential business " of the senate faces expulsion , reports the washington post . " bring the charges , " said booker . " all of us are ready to face that rule , " added fellow democrat richard blumenthal . democrats have been chafing that too many of kavanaugh ' s documents are either being withheld or deemed off limits for the hearing . booker ' s stand comes after the new york times obtained some of those off-limits emails . in one from 2003 , when kavanaugh was working in the white house of george w. bush , he objects to language that roe v. wade is " settled law . " he was going over a draft opinion stating that " it is widely accepted by legal scholars across the board that roe v. wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land , " but he took exception to the phrase . " i am not sure that all legal scholars refer to roe as the settled law of the land at the supreme court level since court can always overrule its precedent , and three current justices on the court would do so , " he wrote at the time . as the times notes , kavanaugh didn ' t state his personal opinion on the matter .
– apparently there are places even south park fears to tread . after getting a death threat from the jihadist website revolutionmuslim.com , the show pulled the prophet mohammed out of this week ' s episode , bleeping out all mention of his name , putting “censored ” banners over parts of the episode and , where necessary , replacing him with santa claus in a bear suit , the huffington post reports . here ' s the deal : last week ' s episode ( which you can see a clip of here ) mocked the taboo against showing the prophet mohammed , having him show up first hidden inside a u-haul , and then inside a bear costume . this week ' s episode was to continue that story . it ' s unclear whether the extra censorship is intended to appease the irony-challenged folks at revolutionmuslim or mock them . south park , incidentally , has tackled the issue before , and even depicted mohammed on screen once with impunity .

" we just felt there were too many unanswered ethical questions " with that extra step , said hopkins ' dr. damon cooney . three other successful penis transplants have been reported , two in south africa and one in 2016 at massachusetts general hospital . those transplants involved only the penis , not extensive surrounding tissue that made this transplant much more complex . hopkins is screening additional veterans to see if they are good candidates for this type of reconstructive transplant . the hopkins patient received an extra experimental step , an infusion of bone marrow from his donor that research suggests may help a recipient ' s immune system better tolerate a transplant . surgeons said that is enabling the veteran to take one anti-rejection drug instead of several . in a statement from hopkins , the patient was quoted as saying : " when i first woke up , i felt finally more normal .

– if you live in america , there ’ s a good chance you ’ re shoveling snow today — or will be soon — but beware : the dreaded chore can actually kill you . how to avoid such a tragic fate ? well , for starters , keep your per-shovel load to 24 pounds or less . beyond that , however , the recommendations get muddled , notes timothy noah on slate : shovels that make it easier to gather the snow make it harder to lift the snow , and vice versa . there is one obscure shovel supposedly better suited to both parts of the job , but good luck finding one in a hardware store . a few other things will lessen your risk : don ’ t start shoveling while snow is still falling ( it ’ s colder , so you ’ ll put additional strain on your heart ) ; don ’ t bundle up too much ( getting too hot isn ’ t good , either ) ; and don ’ t drink coffee ( it increases your heart rate ) or hot cocoa ( who knows why ? ) right before shoveling . if that all sounds like too much trouble , “wait till someone younger or poorer than you knocks on your door and offers to shovel your walk for $ 20 or $ 30 , ” noah recommends . “delegate . the economy will benefit and your cardiologist will thank you . ”

[ the ] results put the original construction of today ' s tomb complex securely in the time of constantine . " ( scientists have issued a dire warning about the site. )

– credit card purchases are about to get a little slower and a lot more secure . consumers have been receiving new cards with fraud-prevention chips and on thursday , a lot more retailers will be asking customers to put their card in a reader instead of swiping it , reports the los angeles times . oct. 1 is the day that the credit card industry will start shifting liability for fraudulent transactions to issuers and merchants that haven ' t adopted the new technology , which is already used in much of the rest of the world and is credited with dramatically reducing fraud by making it harder to duplicate cards . cards without chips will continue to work until they expire , though experts tell the new york times that consumers who have the choice should always opt to dip a card in a reader instead of swiping it . the chips in the new cards use a system known as emv , for creators europay , mastercard , and visa . they contain buyer information and add an extra level of security by creating a new code for every purchase , tech times explains . in europe , consumers need to enter a pin , but us retailers will only require signatures . around 70 % of cards will have chips by the end of this year , according to the la times , though the full switch is expected to take years . retailers worry that the extra few seconds per purchase will slow down businesses at peak times — and that more fraud will now take place online .

– frat-house accidents and sexual assaults are getting so common they ' re impossible to ignore — but how did it get this bad , and why does it keep happening ? in an extensive atlantic piece , caitlin flanagan looks at the history of fraternities and their myriad ways of avoiding legal obligations for what goes on behind closed doors . as bloomberg reported , 60 students have died in frat-related incidents since 2005 , a fact " that is dwarfed by the numbers of serious injuries , assaults , and sexual crimes that regularly take place in these houses , " writes flanagan . she chronicles a few incidents , from a freshman girl ' s heinous rape at wesleyan university to a young man who fired a bottle rocket out of his butt at marshall university — and the guy who fell off a deck videotaping it , and later sued alpha tau omega for his injuries . to avoid financial ruin , fraternities have merged into " vast national organizations " that buy liability insurance , and they ' ve created rules about alcohol consumption that are nearly impossible for party-lovers to follow — so when the inevitable lawsuits come , frat members are considered at fault for breaking the rules . that means their soon-to-be-retired parents pay extensive legal bills , and parents ' homeowners insurance often pays settlements . so why do universities allow this perilous environment to persist ? largely because fraternity dorms save schools " untold millions of dollars " in housing , writes flanagan , and the frat-house party image helps lure students into expensive universities . to be fair , advocates also describe the positives — like increased confidence , brotherhood , and leadership training . but parents should know the dangers : " until proven otherwise , " a lawyer tells flanagan , " they all are very risky organizations for young people to be involved in .

– the wall street journal has revealed a list of potential running mates being vetted by hillary clinton , and it doesn ' t include bernie sanders . possible future vice presidents currently in the early stages of vetting include sen. elizabeth warren of massachusetts , labor secretary tom perez , urban development secretary julian castro , sen. tim kaine of virginia , sen. sherrod brown of ohio , sen. cory booker of new jersey , los angeles mayor eric garcetti , rep. xavier becerra of california , and rep. tim ryan of ohio . a national poll conducted by bloomberg found warren leads in popularity among clinton supporters , 35 % of whom wanted to see her as vice president . she was followed by booker , castro , and al franken . ( newt gingrich was the most popular vp choice on the gop side. ) while some sanders supporters had been hoping for a vice presidential nomination for him , sanders himself wouldn ' t be interested in the position anyway , according to a source close to him . cnn reports sanders would rather work to change the democratic party from the senate than be seen as a " sell-out " or clinton ' s " partner . " that may explain the interest in warren , whose policies are close to those of sanders and who could possibly bring some of his supporters over to clinton . bustle calls her a " shiny apple to sanders ' orange . " sources close to clinton say the top priority for a running mate is someone who would be ready to step in as president , and that advisers aren ' t really looking at what a nominee does for clinton ' s campaign in terms of demographics and geography .
– a new study says one in seven us colon cancer patients is younger than 50 — raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it , reports healthday via the philadelphia inquirer . " colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly , " says lead author samantha hendren . " this study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50 . " using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011 , the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery ( 72 % compared to 63 % of patients over 50 ) . the young are also more likely to use radiation therapy ( 53 % to 48 % ) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years ( 68 % to 67 % ) . younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms ( like colon blockage , bleeding , and anemia ) , while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings , says hendren . " unfortunately , these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids , " a scientist adds , per reuters . hendren ' s team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people , medical daily reports , but that spike remains unexplained . physical inactivity , obesity , smoking , and " an effect in our environment " are all possible causes , a harvard professor says . more screenings for young people might help , but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer . " this would be a big and costly change , " says hendren , who recommends " a lot of research " be done first . ( a new killer is expected to top cancer by 2050. )

– a neglected printing machine and nearly 200 blank money-order forms caught the eye of marc saunders sometime after he started working at the postal service ' s new lisbon , nj , branch in 2014. four years later , saunders has been hit with a five-year probation and ordered to pay the agency back almost $ 100,000 after he pleaded guilty to orchestrating a scheme in which he printed fraudulent money orders and gave them to others to cash , the cherry hill courier-post reports . saunders ' accomplices , who helped him find people to cash the money orders ( including residents of homeless shelters ) , fared worse on the prison front : anthony bell , 39 , was given a year and a day behind bars and a $ 22,400 restitution bill ; eugene bowen , 36 , a 20-month prison sentence and $ 18,500 restitution ; and andre sutton , 39 , a nine-month sentence and $ 4,700 restitution . an affidavit filed in camden federal court by david bannan , a special agent for the usps ' office of inspector general , details how the new lisbon branch phased out the old money-order machine in 2013. because it couldn ' t fit inside the office safe , however , the new lisbon postmaster placed it inside a cabinet ; it remained there when she moved to another branch later that year . the agent details his " evidence pointing to an inside job , " noting saunders ran his scheme between august 2015 and december 2016. most of the money orders were cashed in the philly area , as well as in knoxville , tenn. once the stolen money orders started to emerge , bannan traced the serial numbers to the new lisbon office , where the machine had gone missing . investigators then tied people who did the cashing to the suspects via their facebook connections and cellphone info .
– thinking of giving up booze for the month after a hedonistic holiday season ? well , you might be an alcoholic making a big mistake , writes tom sykes at the telegraph . as a recovering alcoholic , sykes should know . " i managed several sober januaries , and they became an important weapon in my armory of denial , " he writes . a real alcoholic , after all , couldn ' t make it , he reasoned . but the truth is the ritual appeals deeply " to the classic all-or-nothing , getting-away-with-it mentality of the addict , " while " normals " have no use for it . he advises instead trying to have just one drink a night — if stopping after one is difficult , you ' ll know you have a problem . but if you actually are a " normal , " it turns out there might be some merit in the month-long detox . the staff at the new scientist ran a small-scale test on themselves , and got some pretty astonishing results . ten staffers laid off booze for five weeks , and saw their liver fat , blood glucose , and blood cholesterol levels all fall significantly — reducing their risk for liver disease , diabetes , and heart disease — while four staffers who kept drinking saw no changes . but it was a fairly limited experiment , offering no clue how long those effects will last . heather timmons at quartz argues that such " detoxes " are " useless " in the long-term , since the body regularly clears out toxins all on its own . so instead , she recommends taking two or three consecutive days off from drinking each week , since it takes the liver a full day to recover from heavy drinking — plus , over the course of a year , that ensures as many as 150 alcohol-free days .

– scientists have made a long-sought — and controversial — breakthrough : they created stem cells from cloned human embryos for the first time , reports ap . in theory , the development by researchers at oregon health &amp; science university means that doctors might someday be able to grow tissue from an ailing patient ' s own dna , thus reducing the chance of rejection in a transplant . commonly cited examples are growing brain tissue to help a patient with parkinson ' s disease , or pancreatic tissue to help diabetics . it ' s " one landmark step in a very long journey , " says an expert at children ' s hospital boston who wasn ' t involved with the work . the oregon scientists say they don ' t think the embryos used in their process could develop into babies , reports nbc news , but the procedure is nonetheless controversial because it requires that the embryos be destroyed . nature notes that competing technology in the last decade has made the push toward embryonic stem cells less intensive , but adds that the new paper in cell is sure to reignite the debate . the scientists used eggs from donors , and it took six years to replicate the success they had with monkey embryos . they chalked it up to a series of small revisions over the years instead of a single aha ! moment .

– innocent flub ? public diss ? either way , president trump and wife melania provided an unintentionally buzzy moment upon their arrival in tel aviv . watch it via this video clip from the newspaper haaretz . it shows the president reaching back to take wife melania ' s hand on the airport tarmac and then her , well , not taking him up on it . that has triggered lots of coverage along these lines in the daily news : she " refused to hold her husband ' s hand and then slapped it away .

– in 2012 , a marketing research company determined pantone 448 c ( aka " opaque couché " ) was the world ' s ugliest color — and it ' s been used to try to save lives ever since . per the guardian , gfk surveyed 1,000 smokers back then to find out which hue turned them off the most , and this pantone pick — a greenish-brown blend that survey participants said reminded them of " death " and " tar " — emerged the winner . time notes the agency had been commissioned by the australian government to find a color so repellent it could be used on cigarette packaging to discourage people from lighting up . the new color was found to have the most ability to " minimize appeal " and " maximize perceived harm " and was implemented on plain cigarette packs with health warnings across australia , the brisbane times reported at the time . early results are now in , and it appears the color that cnn describes as " sludge-like " may have made an impact : cigarette sales have fallen , and now other countries such as the uk , france , and ireland are following suit , per metro . so what is it about the color that makes it such an effective sales deterrent ? a color consultant tells cnn it may be the strong resemblance to , well , poop . but not everyone ' s on board with trashing opaque couché . pantone sniffs to the guardian , " at the pantone color institute , we consider all colors equally , " noting that the color ' s " deep , rich earth tones " make it a oft-chosen pick for sofas . but perhaps the saddest entity of all ? the long-silent pantone 448 c twitter account , which back in 2012 reacted to the news of its denigrated status by tweeting , " i used to feature so much in all your 70s couches , curtains , and wallpapers . what did i do to deserve this ?

– even those not paying close attention to the world series might be hearing the name kyle schwarber being thrown around a lot after the first two games . as in , " the legend of kyle schwarber " as the chicago cubs catcher puts it , per usa today . the 23-year-old suffered a devastating knee injury in the third game of the season on april 7 and sat out the rest of the year . in a surprise move , the cubs put him back in the lineup for the world series as a designated hitter . after doubling in game 1 — one of the few bright spots for the cubs that game , which came after tv analyst pete rose predicted he ' d strike out three times — schwarber had two rbi singles in the cubs ' game 2 victory and scored another run himself . he ' s batting .429 with two walks . " they ' re going to make movies about him , " says teammate kris bryant . no position player has ever recorded his first hit of the season in the world series . and his " eye " at the plate is astonishing his teammates , notes the chicago tribune . the problem for the cubs is that schwarber is not medically cleared to play the outfield , but that could change before friday ' s game in chicago , where no designated hitter is allowed . but " the next plot twist — “will schwarbs be in left field ? ' — likely will not be a twist at all , " writes ken rosenthal at fox sports .
